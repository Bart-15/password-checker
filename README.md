# Password Checker

The Password Checker verifies if a password meets essential security requirements. It helps users create strong, secure passwords by checking for:

- Minimum length (at least 8 characters)
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one digit
- At least one special character (e.g., @, #, $)

## Code Structure

The project follows the one label of abstraction per function principle. Each function has a single, clear purpose, making the code clean, modular, testable, and easy to maintain.
